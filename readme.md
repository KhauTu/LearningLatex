2. [Why Latex](http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/latex_advocacy.html)
    * It's free.
    * It's available for many machines.
    * The typesetting's better, especially the maths.
    * You can use the editor of your choice (I sometimes use Word).
    * Style changes are neater in LaTeX. Style files for many periodicals exist. Many Word users don't use styles or templates, and there's a limit to what can be done.
    * LaTeX files are ASCII and are portable. Because they're ASCII it's easy to discover how someone achieved an effect.
    * LaTeX is extensible. If you want a new feature, you can look around for a free add-on or write one yourself. Pagemaker Additions and Quark Xtensions exist, but usually cost hundreds of pounds (the MathMagic QuarkXTension for writing maths and importing/exporting TeX docs costs over Â£600).
    * LaTeX's floats are no more awkward than Word's anchored frames, and the latter don't always work well.
